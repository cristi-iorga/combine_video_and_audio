### Short Description


This is a little Windows Batch script that combines a video and audio file. 
It swaps the audio from the video file with that from the audio file. 
Simply run the script and follow the instruction onscreen (you can drag and drop the file into the command line, it will automatically copy the path).


### Typical Usage Scenarios:

Example 1: You filmed a classical concert with a shitty camera. You also recorded it with you super cool, super expensive gear. You want to swap the shitty audio for your cool audio. 
Works only if you synched up your good sound to the bad sound. 

Example 2: You've sent your client the finished video file, but he wants some changes in the audio. You made the changes and exported the new audio.
You don't wanna sit there and import the video file again and render it with the new audio file. That would be a waste of human life.
You need a quick fix to update the sound from the video.

#### Enjoy!
